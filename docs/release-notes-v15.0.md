We are pleased to announce the launch of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 15.0 -  a collection of tools to assist you in managing PostgreSQL. Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL
installs PostgreSQL and complements it by a selection of extensions that are tested to work together and aim to simplify deployment and management of your PostgreSQL environment.

This release of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL is based on [PostgreSQL 15](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/release-15.html). 

## Release Highlights

Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 15 features a lot of new functionalities and enhancements to performance, replication, statistics collection, logging and more. Among them are the following:

* Performance optimizations: 

    - Improved performance of window functions such as `rank()`, `row_number()` and `count()`. Read more about performance and benchmarking results in [Introducing Performance Improvement of Window Functions in PostgreSQL 15](https://www.percona.com/blog/introducing-performance-improvement-of-window-functions-in-postgresql-15/).
    - [Parallel execution](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/parallel-query.html) of queries using the [`SELECT DISTINCT`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/queries-select-lists.html#QUERIES-DISTINCT) command.
    - The support for LZ4 and zstd compression methods to write-ahead logs (WAL) and backup files improves performance and storage capabilities of your database.

* Added the [`MERGE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-merge.html) command, which allows your developers to write conditional SQL statements that can include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` actions within a single statement.
* A [view can now be created with the permissions of the caller](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-createview.html), instead of the view creator. This adds an additional layer of protection to ensure that view callers have the correct permissions for working with the underlying data.
* Enhanced logical replication management:

    - Row filtering and column lists for publishers lets users choose to replicate a subset of data from a table
    - The ability to skip replaying a conflicting transaction and to automatically disable a subscription if an error is detected simplifies the conflict management. 
    - The ability to use two-phase commit (2PC) with logical replication.

* A new logging format [`jsonlog`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-JSONLOG) outputs log data using a defined JSON structure, which allows PostgreSQL logs to be processed in structured logging systems
* Now DBAs can manage the PostgreSQL configuration by granting users permission to alter server-level configuration parameters. Users can also browse the configuration from `psql` using the  `\dconfig` command. 
- [Server-level statistics](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/monitoring-stats.html) are now collected in shared memory, eliminating both the statistics collector process and periodically writing this data to disk
- A new built-in extension, [`pg_walinspect`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/pgwalinspect.html), lets users inspect the contents of write-ahead log files directly from a SQL interface.
